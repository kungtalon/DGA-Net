# DGA-Net: Attention-based Representation Learning of Point Clouds
EECS 545 Machine Learning 2021Fall, University of Michigan

> Recently, attention-based architecture, such as Transformer, has challenged the de-facto status of CNN-based architecture in many computer vision tasks. However, the architectures of networks for learning representations of point clouds are mainly based on MLP or CNN. Here, we explore the effect of attention-based algorithms on both feature extraction and pooling. Furthermore, we observed that many points in a point cloud can be clustered into a groups. Based on this, we try to use spectral clustering as a pooling method to first divide points into groups before achieving the final feature vector of the whole point cloud. We present DGA-Net, a dynamic graph attention-based neural network, which aims to learn representations of point clouds. Experiments indicate that our models achieve competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art models.
